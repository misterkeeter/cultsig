# Cultsig

Open source software for running a cultural event listing in your city.

A simple, no-frills platform for art openings, DIY shows, film screenings, theater, jazz nights, and artist talks — the stuff that's of the scene, not sold to it.

## Status

Early stage. The project is being defined and the platform is in development. The first running instance will be [dfw.cultsig.org](https://dfw.cultsig.org) — Dallas–Fort Worth, Texas.

If you want to follow along or get involved early, open an issue or email [hello@cultsig.org](mailto:hello@cultsig.org).

## What It Will Do

- Public event listing with submission form
- Moderation queue and duplicate detection
- Weekly newsletter with subscriber preferences
- Paid listing support for events that charge admission
- Newsletter sponsorship tooling
- Designed to run cheaply on standard cloud hosting

## How It Works

Free listings for community events. Paid listings for events that charge admission. No featured posts. No algorithm. Chronological order, always.

Each instance is run independently by people embedded in their local scene. The software is shared. The communities are not.

Read the [Charter](CHARTER.md) for the full philosophy.
