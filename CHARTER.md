Cultsig Charter
===============

What Cultsig Is
---------------

Cultsig is open source software for running a cultural event listing in your
city. It is a public utility, not a platform. Its job is to make the local
cultural scene legible.

Each instance of Cultsig runs independently, with people embedded in their local
scene. The software is shared. The communities are not.

The Filter
----------

Cultsig lists events that are **of the scene**, not sold to it.

This means community-rooted culture: gallery openings, DIY shows, house
concerts, microcinema screenings, weekly jazz residencies, theater collective
work, artist talks, open mics, and community performances. Events where the
people running them and the people attending them are largely the same
community.

It does not mean commercial entertainment products directed at a general
audience: touring acts at commercial venues, Ticketmaster events, corporate
productions, festival brand activations, or anything that doesn't need a
community calendar to find its audience.

The filter is a judgment call, not a formula. Moderators should ask: Does this
event exist because of the local scene, or does it exist despite it?

How Listings Work
-----------------

**Free listings** — any event with free admission can be listed for free. No
exceptions, no fees.

**Paid listings** — any event that charges admission pays to be listed. A flat
fee per listing, or a monthly subscription for venues posting regularly.

There are no featured listings. There is no promoted content. There is no
algorithm. Events appear in chronological order, always. Sponsors support the
infrastructure. They do not influence what gets listed or where it appears.

Editorial Independence
----------------------

Cultsig is not neutral — the filter is an editorial position. But within that
filter, every qualifying event is treated equally. Money does not buy
visibility. Relationships do not buy placement. The calendar is the calendar.

Moderators are expected to apply the filter consistently and to document edge
cases so the filter can be refined over time. Exception requests are a useful
signal — the people who push back on rejections often understand the scene best.

Sustainability
--------------

Each regional instance is responsible for its own sustainability. The revenue
model is intentionally simple: paid listings from commercial events subsidize
free listings for community events, and newsletter sponsorships cover
operational costs.

The goal is for each instance to run cheaply on standard cloud hosting, operated
part-time by one or two people who are already part of the local scene.

Open Source
-----------

All Cultsig software is released under the AGPL-3.0 license. Anyone can fork it,
run it, and modify it. If you run a modified version as a public service, you
must release your changes under the same license.

The project does not seek to control how Cultsig is used in other cities. It
seeks to make it easy to run well.

What This Is Not
----------------

Cultsig is not a ticketing platform. It is not a social network. It is not
trying to aggregate everything. It is not trying to be the biggest calendar in
your city. It is trying to be the most trusted one.
